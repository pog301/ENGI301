# Project 2

The goal of project 2 was to create a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design for an Etch-a-Sketch. The PCB contains the following components in the front of the board:
1) SPI screen to draw on
2) x2 potentiometers (one for moving in the x direction and the other one for moving in the y direction) 
3) x2 buttons (one for changing the color you draw with and another one for reseting the game)
4) x3 LEDs (one red, one blue and one green to display the drawing color)

The PCB also has the following in the back:
1) USB Port
2) PocketBeagle

Additionally, the subfolder for this project ("project_02") within this repository contains the following subfolders:
1) A subfolder named "EAGLE" with the Library, Schematics and Layout needed to build the PCB
2) A subfolder named "MFG" containing all of the manufacturing files for the PCB
3) A subfolder named "docs" with any other documents submitted to the course as part of this project

Disclaimer: This is student work developed as part of a course. As such, some components might be missing and the quality is that of someone learning this for the first time. Additionally, a lot of the content was developed as part of the course or facilitated by the work done in the course. Thus, I take no responsibility for the use of any part of the project. Also, my professor helped me throughout the process, so I might not know the answers to some of the questions.

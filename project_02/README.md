# Project 2

The goal of project 2 was to create a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design for an Etch-a-Sketch. 

The folder for this project ("project_02") within this repository contains a file named EAGLE with the Library, Schematics and Layout needed to build the PCB. Additionally, ny other documents submitted to the course as part of this project can be seen in the "docs" folder within "project_02". 

Disclaimer: This is student work developed as part of a course. As such, some components might be missing and the quality is that of someone learning this for the first time. Additionally, a lot of the content was developed as part of the course or facilitated by the work done in the course. Thus, I take no responsibility for the use of any part of the project. Also, my professor helped me throughout the process, so I might not know the answers to some of the questions.

# Project 2

The goal of project 2 was to create a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design for an Etch-a-Sketch. 

The folder for this project ("project_02") within this repository contains the following folders:
1) A folder named "EAGLE" with the Library, Schematics and Layout needed to build the PCB
2) A folder named "MFG" containing all of the manufacturing files for the PCB
3) A folder named "docs" with any other documents submitted to the course as part of this project

Disclaimer: This is student work developed as part of a course. As such, some components might be missing and the quality is that of someone learning this for the first time. Additionally, a lot of the content was developed as part of the course or facilitated by the work done in the course. Thus, I take no responsibility for the use of any part of the project. Also, my professor helped me throughout the process, so I might not know the answers to some of the questions.

# Mini Rube Goldberg with Game 

Project 1: Building a simplified system based on Rube Goldberg machines. Here is the link to the Hackster.io page for the project: .

This folder has two subfolders:

      2.1) docs
      This folder contains some documents developed for the project as part of course deliverables.  
      Note: these files were developed to help with the project and made for the class but they do not reflect the final product for the         
      project; they were not updated. For guidelines on how the end project is built and what was actually implemented, please go to my     
      Hackster.io page linked above. 
      
      2.2) project_01_python
      This itself has two subfolders:
              2.2.1) p_01_main_code
              This contains a file with the main code for the project as well as a file to configure the pins and another one to run it.
              2.2.2) p_01_other
              This contains some additional files developed for the project which are called within the main project file.        
      Any other file implemented for the project but not found within "project_01_python" can be found within the python file in the main GitHub       repository. 


Software Build Instructions:

1) Start with "p_01_main_code" to make a main code file for the whole project and save it in a folder named "p_01_main_code"
2) Use the other files referred within the p_01_main_code file to make the whole system work; save the files in "p_01_other" to a folder with that name as well as any other files within the python folder needed to their respective folders.
3) Make sure to have the "configure_pins_p01.sh" as well as the "run_p01" files within the "p_01_main_code". 
Note: if you decide to change any naming convention or location of files in general, you will have to make sure that it is updated where appropriate. Also make sure that the "run_p01" is updated to show the right path. Also, if any other pin in the Pocketbeagle is used instead of the ones I used, make sure to update the "configure_pins_p01.sh" file as well.

Software Operation Instructions
1) Autoboot 


Disclaimer: This is student work developed as part of a course. As such, some components might be missing or do not work as desired, and the quality is that of someone learning this for the first time. Additionally, a lot of the code was developed as part of the course or facilitated by the work done in the course. Thus, I take no responsibility for the use of any part of the project. Also, my professor helped me throughout the whole process, from giving ideas to helping me make things work, so I might not know the answers to some of the questions.
